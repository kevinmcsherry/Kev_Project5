# Project 5 Ecommerce - Golf Gear

Golf Gear is a website in which all avid golfers will love!  It allows all shoppers to visit, browse, create an account and finally purchase the items they desire.
A user will visit the site, be greeted with colourful and easy to navigate pages.  They can view all the products that are available, which range from clothing, clubs and accessories - everything a golfer needs!
In order to purchase an item, the user must create an account, which they can do easily via an available link, and by just filling in a few details - they are ready.
Once a user is logged in, they can then select any items in which they want to purchase... add them to thier basket and purchase...all with 4 clicks of a button and entering delivery information.
If the logged user can not make up thier mind and wish to log off and have a think...they can do so without issue - the next time they log in, thier basket items will still be held for them!
We accept payment via Paypal or Credit Card!
Enjoy the Site!
